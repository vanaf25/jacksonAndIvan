      title: "Progress and Time of Completion of Work",
      content: `Subcontractor agrees to commence construction as soon as the site is ready for his phase of the work, and in any case within two (2) days after notice from the Contractor to proceed, and to complete each part of his work expeditiously and in time to avoid delaying any other work at the job site. Should the Subcontractor fail, be unable, or refuse to supply sufficient manpower to the job, for any reason whatsoever, it shall be a material breach of this subcontract. Subcontractor shall strictly comply with any time schedule, set by the Contractor at any time, and the instructions of the Contractor's job superintendent. If the Subcontractor is delayed in the judgment of the Contractor by any labor dispute (whether or not the labor dispute is with the Subcontractor), the Contractor (in addition to any other remedy at the law or equity) shall have the right to immediately replace the Subcontractor, in which case the Subcontractor shall vacate the job and be paid (after completion of the replacement subcontractor's work) the amount provided on Page One hereof, less the cost incurred by the Contractor for the replacement subcontractor's charges in completing the work. The work required herein is in any event to be completed in accordance with the current construction schedule, referred to as Exhibit "C".`

      title: "Payment Schedule",
      content: `Unless otherwise stated herein, payments to Sub-contractor shall be made monthly as the work progresses. On or before the 20th of each month, or other date as designated by the contractor, Subcontractor shall provide the Contractor with duplicate invoices and Labor and Material Lien Releases for all sums due for work and materials furnished up to the date of the invoice. The submission of subcontract progress estimates shall constitute a representation by the Subcontractor that all previous payments have been properly applied by Subcontractor to the payment of all second-tier subcontractor and material supplier billings, which, in turn, formed the basis of the prior progress estimates. Subcontractor further represents and warrants that, upon receipt of the progress estimate represented by each current progress estimate, a similar process will be followed, and all second-tier subcontractors and material suppliers whose billings form the basis for the current progress estimate will be similarly paid and satisfied in full, excepting only those instances in which there is a legitimate good faith dispute between the Subcontractor and a second-tier subcontractor or material supplier with respect to performance or related matters. In such event, the Subcontractor will notify Contractor, which, in turn, will withhold such moneys pending resolution of the dispute between the Subcontractor and the second-tier subcontractor or material supplier. Labor and Material Lien Release forms utilized shall be as provided by the contractor to the subcontractor with the contract package. The Subcontractor shall, as a minimum, prepare a schedule of values that assigns revenue to his activities in the construction schedule and shall assign five percent (5%) of the total contract value to an activity titled O&M Manuals & Punch list. Contractor reserves the right to approve subcontractor’s schedule of values, and values for mobilization may not be allowed. Progress payments will be released approximately ten (10) days after receiving payment from the Owner. Payment by the owner is a condition precedent to contractor’s obligation to pay subcontractor. Payment for O&M activities shall be paid thirty (30) days after completion if the contract has been fully performed to the satisfaction of the Owner and the Contractor and the delivery to the Contractor of all Lien Releases for Labor and Material.`
