        It has come to our attention that this agreement has recently been breached.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        You have violated this contract in the following ways:
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{mb:1}}>Some contract</Typography>
      <Typography sx={{mb:1}}>Some contract</Typography>
      <Typography sx={{mb:1}}>Some contract</Typography>
      <Typography sx={{mb:1}}>
        Since you violated theses parts of the agreement this contract has therefore been breached.
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{mb:1}}>
        As a result of the breach the company will be stopping the production of work and begin collection activity until an agreement repairing the breach can be found.
      </Typography>

        The Company is requesting your attendance at a contract breach hearing on
        <BlueBlock text={"Some text"}/>

        Please let me know as soon as possible via email if you will be able to make it.
